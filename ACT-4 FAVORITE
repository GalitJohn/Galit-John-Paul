title="Messenger"></a>
<p> MESSENGER  I used the messenger because this is way to communicate with other people. and it helps to have more friends through 
chatting and build a strong friendship. and also i used it to inform me everything like in our group chat because sometimes i didnt notice the 
notifucations from my gmail thats why i relying on messager. and also i always open my messenger since our both parents have work far away 
from our home and they want us to inform us. and i can say tat messenger are part of my life since pandemic now i we cannot visit our relatives 
immediately so through cahtting or calling them is big helps for us. . </p><br></br>

title="Google maps"></a>
<p>GOOGLE MAPS used this google maps because i know in myself that im not totally familiar with some places. since i grow up with having 
strict parents so even im 21 years old this year but im still like a child that dont know how to go in somewhere. thats why this maps its really 
helpful in me beacuse i used it in order fo me na hindi maligaw. im just look the trademark and if i alraedy there in that particular places so it 
easy for me to find the places where i want to go. so this is one important to me </p><br></br>

<p>GOOGLE CLASSROOM Honestly, even i dont want this app because a lot activities will pop up. but i need this app because this is my proof 
that i gaining knowledge from my prof. and also i realized that i i didnt listen because some obstable like a enviromental barriers. and if i 
encounter like that issues so its easy for me to access in my google classrom and find a lesson and so i can review it. beacuse im become lazy 
if i didnt follow the lesson from the start because i will not understand the next lesson. thats why even i dont want a google classroom but it 
helps in my future.. </p><br></br>

<p>I usually used this youtube to searching everything that i want to know and learned. in youtube i always search a worship song because 
everytime i felt stress or not im always go in youtube a play some music. and another reason why im going in youtube is searching a lot of 
tagalog tutorial from my subject because im not just realying on prof. i wnat to expand my knowledge when it comes on my major subject and 
since im lack of equipment so i need to study very well. In inorder for me to understand very wel. </p><br></br>
